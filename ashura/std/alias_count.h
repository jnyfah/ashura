/// having access to and being able to reference this struct already implies a
/// reference count of 1, meaning total refs = 1 + num_other_aliases.
///
/// this requires that the accessing scope knows it has access to it or not and
/// can in some cases be statically checked.
///
/// the reference count is initialized by default. 0-based means initialization
/// can be a memset if lock-free.

/// NOTE: just like reference-counting, this only guarantees synchronization of
